# Night City Chrome & Data Services

> *"He was more than a dolphin, but from another dolphin's point of view he might have seemed like something less."* — William Gibson, "Johnny Mnemonic"

A cyberpunk-themed exploration of **[Temporal](https://temporal.io/)** for building durable, reliable workflows. This project demonstrates the Saga pattern with compensating transactions, along with Temporal's built-in reliability features like automatic retries, durable execution, and workflow visibility.

## The Domain

Welcome to Night City. Megacorporations rule, data is the ultimate currency, and getting chromed up at a ripperdoc is just another Tuesday. We use this setting to explore how Temporal handles complex, multi-step workflows that interact with multiple external systems—and what happens when things go wrong.

### 1. 🦾 Cyberware Installation Saga

**The Saga Pattern with Compensating Transactions**

Installing cyberware requires coordinating four independent systems, each with its own persistent state:

| System | Purpose | Compensation |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Fixer Inventory** | Reserve cyberware from the black market | Release reservation, pay restocking fee |
| **Ripperdoc Scheduling** | Book surgery appointment | Cancel appointment, forfeit deposit |
| **Credstick Ledger** | Process payment (blockchain-backed) | Issue refund (minus processing fee) |
| **Neural Registry** | Track cyberware integration | Emergency stabilization |

**The Problem:** If neural integration fails mid-surgery (and with experimental chrome, it often does), we need to:
1. Stabilize the runner (emergency medical!)
2. Refund the payment
3. Cancel the appointment
4. Release the cyberware reservation

Each compensation runs in **reverse order (LIFO)** to maintain consistency across all systems.

```
SUCCESS PATH:
Reserve → Schedule → Pay → Integrate → Confirm ✓

FAILURE PATH (Integration fails):
Reserve → Schedule → Pay → Integrate ✗
                                ↓
        Emergency Stabilization
                                ↓
        ← Refund ← Cancel ← Release
```

### 2. 📡 Data Broker Scatter-Gather

**Parallel Requests with Aggregation**

When you need to move data through the underground networks, you don't call one broker—you query them all and pick the best deal. This demonstrates Temporal's ability to run activities in parallel and aggregate results.

| Broker | Specialty | Reliability |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Afterlife Connections** | Premium service, high success rate | 95% |
| **NetWatch Black Market** | Fast but risky (rogue agents) | 70% |
| **Arasaka External Services** | Corporate precision, slow | 90% |
| **Voodoo Boys Data Haven** | AI constructs, military encryption | 85% |
| **Militech Acquisitions** | Aggressive, military specialist | 82% |

**SCATTER:** Query all 5 brokers simultaneously  
**GATHER:** Analyze responses, find best by price/speed/reliability

### 3. 🎯 Heist Process Manager

**Long-Running Workflows with Signals and Queries**

Coordinating a shadowrun requires more than just a plan—it needs a state machine that can respond to real-time intel. This demonstrates Temporal's signals (external events that affect running workflows) and queries (inspect state without affecting execution).

**Phases:**
```
planning → team_assembly → gear_acquisition → infiltration → execution → extraction → completed
                                                                                      ↓
                            [abort signal] ─────────────────────────────────────→ aborted
```

**Signals:**
- `abortHeist(reason)` - Emergency abort at any phase
- `updateAlertLevel(delta, source)` - External intel about security
- `confirmTeamReady()` - Gate team assembly phase

**Queries:**
- `getHeistState()` - Inspect current operation status

## Running the Demos

### Prerequisites

1. Docker and Docker Compose
2. Node.js 18+
3. pnpm (or npm/yarn)

### Setup

```bash
# Start Temporal server
docker compose up -d

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the worker
pnpm run worker
```

### Run Scenarios

```bash
# Cyberware Installation Saga (may trigger compensation!)
pnpm run saga

# Data Broker Scatter-Gather
pnpm run scatter

# Heist Process Manager
pnpm run heist

# Heist with Abort Signal
pnpm run heist:abort
```

## The True Beauty of Sagas

The Saga pattern shines when things go wrong. Consider this scenario:

**Scenario: Installing Experimental Cyberware**

A runner walks into a street clinic for experimental time-dilation cyberware. The process:

1. ✅ **Fixer reserves the chrome** - €$75,000 military prototype locked in
2. ✅ **Ripperdoc appointment scheduled** - Doc blocks 6 hours, deposit paid
3. ✅ **Payment processed** - Runner's credstick debited, blockchain confirms
4. ❌ **Neural integration FAILS** - Compatibility score 62% (needed 75%)

**Without Sagas:** The runner is out €$75,000, has a seizure on the operating table, the doc still has the appointment blocked, and the chrome sits in limbo.

**With Sagas:** The compensation chain fires:

```
[NEURAL REGISTRY] ⚠ EMERGENCY STABILIZATION for runner RUN-001
[NEURAL REGISTRY] Flooding system with neural suppressants...
[NEURAL REGISTRY] Disconnecting failed cyberware interfaces...
[NEURAL REGISTRY] ✓ Stabilization successful. Neural damage: 5%

[COMPENSATION 1/3] Refund credstick payment
[CREDSTICK LEDGER] ✓ Refund processed. Refunded: €$74,125.00, Fee kept: €$3,901.32

[COMPENSATION 2/3] Cancel ripperdoc appointment  
[RIPPERDOC] ✓ Appointment cancelled. Deposit forfeited: €$400.00

[COMPENSATION 3/3] Release inventory reservation
[FIXER INVENTORY] ✓ Released reservation. Restocking fee: €$11,250.00

SAGA COMPENSATION COMPLETE
  Total charged: €$78,125.00
  Total refunded: €$74,125.00
  Net cost to runner: €$4,000.00
```

The runner survives with minor neural scarring, gets most of their money back (minus fees for everyone's trouble), and the chrome goes back to the fixer for the next runner brave enough to try.

## Why Temporal?

Temporal handles the hard parts of distributed systems:

- **Durability:** Workflow state survives crashes, restarts, even data center failures
- **Visibility:** Full execution history for debugging and auditing
- **Retries:** Automatic retry with exponential backoff—built in, not bolted on
- **Signals/Queries:** External interaction with running workflows
- **Compensations:** Clean rollback handling when things go sideways

You write what looks like normal code. Temporal makes it reliable.
